# nosql_api
API REST in NodeJS for manage NoSQL Databases
The objective of this project is to have a database with all kind of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive status.

# What is Counter-Strike: Global Offensive
CS:GO is one of the most played online videogames in the world.
Currently, it has more than 300.000 players online each day, with a lot of worldwide competitions and professional players.

# Why CS:GO?
CS:GO is a really good base for extract a lot of kinds of information:

 - Guns stats (class, damage, bullets, rounds per minute...)
 - Which guns are the most used
 - Player stats (precision, time played, rank...)
 - Map stats (most played, valoration...)

That´s why I´ve chosen this. I also play CS:GO, so that´s another good reason I guess.

# FAQ
I don´t know what to write here at the moment, so I´ll think in something while I´m developing this little project.
